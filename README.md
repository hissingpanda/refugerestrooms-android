Android app for [Refuge Restrooms](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/)

## Getting started
You can use Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) to build this project, and it should behave like any other android studio project.

Clone the repo here and the in Android Studio go to File -> New -> Import Project and navigate to your clone.

## Functionality
- Works best with GPS Location enabled
- Uses [Google Maps Gestures](https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3139292?hl=en)
- Selecting location marker shows bathroom info and changes navigation to that location
- Navigation icon in the top right gives text directions
- Blue marker = accessible, red marker = not accessible
- When GPS isn't enabled
  - Popup box will recommend turning it on initial app start
  - Navigation icon gives a toast to enable location
  - Selecting marker doesn't give location
  - Currently location defaults to Minneapolis (Fix this!)
  - Only really useful to use search
- If no bathroom within 30(ish?) miles, no results are given by refuge restrooms api, so a toast displays to the user that no bathrooms are nearby
- Max locations shown initially: gps = 20, search = 75
- Searching with no GPS will move camera to first location found, and shows a toast saying locations were found

## TODO
- [x] Search bar
  - [ ] Search by address option -- need to translate address to lat/lng
  - [ ] Auto-complete search (google places api)
- [ ] Get and set nearby location when gps is disabled (currently defaults to Minneapolis)
	- [ ] Populate map with nearby pins like when gps is enabled
- [ ] Add list view to Drawer menu like in the original app w\ BathroomSpecsViewUpdater, DetailViewActivity (files in older commits)
  - [ ] Feature to save bathrooms for offline use
- [x] Detailed info window
  - [ ] Allow users to rate and report bathrooms
- [ ] Re-style map pin custom info window
- [ ] Indicate red markers vs blue markers for accessibility
- [ ] Settings Menu
  - [ ] Add option to turn off navigation so that the blue line doesn't appear on map.
  - [ ] Change colors of navigation line, map markers (accessible vs non-accessible)
  - [ ] Select number of bathrooms to show 1-99 (increase default)
- [ ] Style
  - [x] Style Feedback Form better
  - [ ] Navigation drawer icons
  - [ ] Style text directions section -- directions.html
- [ ] Better add bathroom section, currently just a webview
  - [x] Style webview in the meantime
- [ ] Contact form without email client
- [ ] Update text directions while on tab
- [ ] Actionbar activity depreciated (HttpClient as well)
- [ ] Add different locales in strings.xml file

## Bugs
- [ ] Screen rotation re-updates map to initial closest location (it re-initiates the map activity)
- [ ] Screen rotation removes add a bathroom text
- [ ] Map reinstantiates every time a search occurs
- [ ] Turning location off after it's been on doesn't grab last known location on app reopen
- [ ] Can select location button underneath detailed window view (hard to do, but moves map while fragment is displayed over)
- [x] Going back from text directions removes polyline
- [x] GPS not enabled message shows after every search
- [x] Searching a second time doesn't remove first search pins
